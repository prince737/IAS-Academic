								<p>The syllabus of the entrance test is different for different courses and can be obtained from the information desk at the applying centre.</p>
								<p>The admission test also gives an opportunity to the student to perform higher and get scholarship also. A student, who has been qualified for our direct admission criteria, can also sit for SET and get himself/herself a scholarship.</p>
								<p>A student can appear in the SET for a maximum of two chances for seeking admission in a particular course.</p>
								<p>If a student has taken direct admission and paid registration fee, admission fee & 1st instalment of the remaining fee, then he/she cannot appear for SET to avail any scholarship benefit.
